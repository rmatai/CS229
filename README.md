# CS229

Thank you to all the [infamous] CS229 instructors and TAs for an equally enjoyable and excrutiating course! Truly, we learned a lot :) Thank you.

We would like to point out that we excluded code that we recognized as having Netflix information that we do not share publicly. This includes feature extraction pipelines and code, source metadata information, and detailed information regarding our popularity metrics and title streaming behavior. This information is sensitive in nature as it influences and affects contracts with content providers.

We hope to take more ML courses in the future, specifically we both would like to try CS 230. We feel that given the project-based focus of the course, we would be able to dedicate a lot more of our time to that learning process, by again applying it to problems within our own work priorities.
